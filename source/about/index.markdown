Previously a literary agent at a successful publishing startup, I partnered with platform-driven authors to develop and sell their literary properties to publishers. I focused on everything from cookbooks to titles that advance social causes. I also managed my companyâ€™s financial operations, helping to efficiently upscale its systems to accommodate a 400%+ increase in volume while saving $25,000+ per year. The tech world drew me in when I forged a relationship between my company and a non-profit that provides free e-books and e-readers to developing countries in Africa & Asia. By the time I became involved, this initiative had already impacted 300,000+ lives -- and I was eager to join the world where this kind of success and reach is routine. I made the move to Flatiron School to learn to code and jump into a new career where I could contribute directly to new initiatives and be even more passionate about the work I do every day.
