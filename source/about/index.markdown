<p>
Previously a literary agent at a successful startup <a href="http://www.foliolit.com">agency</a>, I partnered with platform-driven authors to develop and sell their literary properties to publishers. I focused on everything from cookbooks to titles that advance social causes. I also managed my companyâ€™s financial operations, helping to efficiently upscale its systems to accommodate rapid growth.
</p>
<p>
The tech world drew me in when I forged a relationship between my company and a non-profit that provides free e-books and e-readers to developing countries in Africa & Asia. By the time I became involved, this initiative had already impacted 300,000+ lives -- and I was eager to join the world where this kind of success and reach is routine. Programming had always interested me, so I taught myself basic Ruby, Javascript, HTML & CSS, and went on to build several small programs. I promptly fell in love with coding.

<p>
I now work at <a href="http://www.venuenext.com/#welcome">VenueNext</a> as a software engineer. I have a keen interest in searching and data management in addition to working as a full stack developer.
